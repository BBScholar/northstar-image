# Northstar Image Generation
Github action that creates bootable images to run Northstar vision. 


### Settings
To change network settings, modify `/etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml`

To change northstar configs, modify various files in `/opt/northstar`

### Calibration
Haven't figured this one out yet

### Credit
Pipeline is one-to-one copied from FRC6328, only small modifications to allow for command line arguments.

Github workflow more or less copied from PhotonVision.
